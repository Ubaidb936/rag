"What significant problem does a relational database minimize?
","A relational database, which is the most popular type of database, minimizes data redundancy. This is achieved by organizing data into tables, with even the information about the tables stored in tables. The relationships among tables are defined by repeating an attribute or column from one table in another table, known as 'keys'. This design significantly reduces the need to store the same data in multiple places within the database","
