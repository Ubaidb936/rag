"Why is it important to be consistent in naming database objects?
","Consistency in naming database objects is crucial because it promotes clarity and understanding of the database structure. If different naming conventions are used for similar objects, it can lead to confusion and make it difficult to maintain and modify the database. The disadvantage of not being consistent is that it can result in errors, reduced productivity, and difficulty in collaborating with other developers. Naming conventions can also play a significant role in documenting a database by providing a clear and consistent labeling system that makes it easier to understand the purpose and relationships of different database objects","
Consistency is important because it helps to ensure that everyone understands the purpose and meaning of the database object.

"What is a deletion anomaly in the context of databases?
","A deletion anomaly in a database refers to an unintended loss of other data that occurs when one piece of data is deleted. This can happen when the same data is repeated in several places in a database table, and deleting that data from one place results in the loss of related data from other places. For example, if an employee record is deleted from a database table, it might inadvertently delete all information about a project that the employee was working on, even if that project involved other employees as well. Deletion anomalies can be avoided by organizing data in a database according to certain ""normal forms,"" which are designed to eliminate such anomalies","
A deletion anomaly occurs when deleting one piece of data accidentally deletes all information about a different piece of data. For instance, the Employee table mentioned earlier. If Lisa Sanderson were to quit and be deleted from the table, we would also lose all information about the project DB134. Even if she were the only employee assigned to the project, information about the project should be available after she leaves.

However, it can be useful in certain situations where performance is more important than data consistency.

"What is the default schema in SQL Server?
","The default schema in SQL Server is called ""SCHEMA"". This means that if a new database object is created without specifying a schema, it will be automatically assigned to the ""SCHEMA"" schema","



","

"
"How does SQL Server handle user access to database objects?
","In SQL Server, you can create schemas that are independent of a given user and then create sets of objects that belong to that schema. Users can be assigned to the schema and given access to those objects, with a user who is a member of a schema being limited to accessing only the objects in that schema. Schemas in SQL Server behave like roles, but while a role is a collection of permissions, a schema is a collection of objects owned by a schema. A student schema, for example, would own any stored procedures or views needed for student access to the database, and a student user would be assigned to the schema and then granted permissions on the schema objects","
SQL Server uses a combination of logins and users to control access to database objects.

","
SQL Server uses a security model that is based on users, roles, and permissions. A user is an entity that has been granted permission to connect to a server or to access a specific object in a database. Roles are groups of users who have similar permissions. Permissions are rights to perform actions on objects such as tables, views, stored procedures, and databases.
