1. Hierarchical
2. Network
3. Object"
"How are hierarchical databases visually represented?
","Hierarchical databases are visually represented in a tree-like structure, similar to a file system in operating systems like Windows, Mac, or Linux. In this structure, one parent table can have multiple child tables, but a child table can have only one parent. This organization is logical and easy to navigate, but it can present issues such as data redundancy and data integrity","

"What is the reason large institutions are reluctant to switch to newer database products?
","Large institutions such as banks and insurance companies are often reluctant to switch to newer database products because they have heavily invested in the development of their existing hierarchical databases and have committed decades of data to their files. They are hesitant to incur the time, money, and risk of redeveloping their databases and translating their vast stores of existing data into new formats, even if database technologies have improved","

"
"What significant problem does a relational database minimize?
","A relational database, which is the most popular type of database, minimizes data redundancy. This is achieved by organizing data into tables, with even the information about the tables stored in tables. The relationships among tables are defined by repeating an attribute or column from one table in another table, known as 'keys'. This design significantly reduces the need to store the same data in multiple places within the database","
